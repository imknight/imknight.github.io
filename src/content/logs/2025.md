* **Feb 2025**
  Trying to build **Filament Flow** – a plugin to create a content engine on FilamentPHP. Migrated my blog from Hashnode to Flow and built a [**Flow**] prototype.

* **Mar 2025**
  Officially launched my first Filament plugin on Composer – **Filament Assist**.

* **Apr 2025**
  Built the **ImageGPT** prototype to generate images from text using the ChatGPT Image Model.

* **May 2025**
  Evolved **ImageGPT** into **RenderTogether**, aiming to make it an AI image generator for teams – *From idea to image, together*.

* **May 2025**
  **Imknight.com v4** – migrated from Filament Flow back to Ghost.

* **May 2025**
  **Imknight.dev v2** – migrated from Carrd to Astro.

* **May 2025**
  Built **RebuildHQ** – an AI product analyzer using Vibe Coding with Zed, pivoted from the previous “Admin Panel as a Service” idea.

* **June 2025**
  Joined Bolt's World Largest Hackathon 2025 and built **EchoMood** with Bolt. Got stuck trying to get the native mobile build working, so pivoted to a mobile web app for now.
